## nonlinear-performance 

It appears that you are discussing project dynamics and performance, particularly focusing on the relationship between the amount of delivered functionality and its support over time. You have mentioned two key points:

1. **Linear Dependency Assumption:** You assume that there is a linear dependency between the amount of delivered functionality and its support. In other words, you expect that as you deliver more functionality, the level of support required increases linearly.

2. **Plato Stage:** You observe that the project tends to reach a plateau stage over time, where it becomes challenging to deliver new functionality. This plateau suggests that there might be limitations or constraints that hinder further functionality delivery, despite the linear dependency assumption.

This analysis can be interpreted as follows:

- Initially, as you deliver more functionality, the level of support needed increases as expected due to the assumed linear dependency.

- However, over time, you encounter a situation where the support required continues to increase, but the increase in functionality delivered starts to slow down. This may indicate that the project is reaching its limits in terms of what it can deliver given the available resources, technology, or other constraints.

- The "plato stage" is a point where the project reaches a stable state, and it becomes challenging to introduce significant new functionality without addressing the underlying limitations.

In summary, your analysis suggests that projects may follow a pattern where linear dependencies exist initially, but they may encounter limitations over time that lead to a plateau in functionality delivery. This observation can be valuable for project planning and resource allocation, as it highlights the need to address potential constraints that could impact project performance.
